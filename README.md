Kimber Stallings # klstallings.github.io
My school Github account to work on assignments and build a working knowledge of the program.
I created a repository to show my learning and contributions to my class work.
I downloaded Github to my desktop from the website, used my created account and followed directions  to clone the repository created. I created and named a file to acces my Github repository.
